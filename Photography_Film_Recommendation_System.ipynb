    "This recommendation system, unfortunately, was not as effective in this analysis in comparison to the numeric one. Due to the fact that there were multiple attributes that were assigned to each film type for their \"uses,\" they all produced unique combinations that sometimes did not align. Kodak Portra 400 has film use purposes such as Portraits, General Purpose, and Product - only 7 of the recommended films had one or two overlaps, yet no exact match. This means that even though there might be films that have all three of those attributes, the system didn't take them into account, like, for example, the Fuji Provia 100F - which has all of those film use cases. \n",
