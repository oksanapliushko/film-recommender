There are three components to this project:
1. **Filmtypes.csv** - This is the dataset that I have created based on the [**Film Types website**:](https://www.filmtypes.com/) and used for my recommendation system project.

2. **Photography_Film_Recommendation_System.ipynb** - This is the primary notebook that I have used for my project, where you can find the recommendation system itself. Please go through this notebook first. It also includes a bibliography of the code used.

3. **Interactive_Film_Recommendation_Chat.ipynb** - In this notebook, I wanted to try to play around and create an interactive, more user-friendly recommendation system, with and without photos. It also includes a bibliography of the code used.
